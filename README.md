# INFORM ME

Staying up-to-date in our rapidly changing world is hard. From general news to business, techonology...  

Your favorite podcast show/playlist that informs you hasn't been uploading in a while / only uploads once a week.  
It's usually hard to surf in new's websites,  ah wish they were audited!
